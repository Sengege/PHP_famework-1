                        These terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as "Terms") apply to the use of the Swope services (hereinafter referred to as “the Operator”). The Terms available at Swope at the exact time of usage of the Swope services will be applied. By using Swope services, the user accepts the Terms. If the user does not accept the Terms, the use of any Swope services is prohibited.

                        Swope is a marketplace where registered users can offer and exchange a variety of goods, skills or experiences (hereinafter referred to as "Products"). This is permitted as long as offers, sales and/or acquisitions do not violate statutory prepositions, good morals and/or the Terms.
                        <br/>
                        The use of the Swope basic service version is free of charge.
                        <br/>
                        The operator is not responsible for content generated by users. However, there is no right for publication of content. Participation on Swope is not enforceable and can also not be compelled or required in any other form. The operator reserves the right to deny the participation of Swope temporarily or permanently even without further reasons. A new registration under a different name and/or other e-mail address following having been blocked is not allowed. If a user has been blocked, he/she may contact the operator via e-mail to contact@swope.uk and request for clarification regarding this matter.

                        The operator only provides information as well as a technical framework for users. Claims of contracts between users cannot be claimed from the operator. The operator is not a contracting party. The contracts are exclusively concluded between the users of the marketplace. The fulfilment of these contracts concluded via Swope is carried out exclusively among the users. The operator therefore only provides the technical framework for users to conclude such contracts.
                        <br/>
                        The user is not entitled to download the displayed information on a computer or any other data medium. The repeated and systematic downloading of part of the displayed information, even of an insignificant nature and scope, is equivalent to downloading a substantial nature and scope or part of the displayed information. Moreover, the use of a computer program for the automatic read-out of data in particular, such as scraping, crawlers, spiders or bots is absolutely prohibited. Printing of the displayed information is only allowed for private purposes and only to an absolutely necessary extent. Any use of information for business purposes, in particular for commercial use, is forbidden.

                        Users have to register to use most of the features. Registration is free of charge for users. The use of the Swope service is permitted for individuals over the age of 14 years, who are viable to entering a legally binding contract.
                        <br/>
                        Commercial use is strictly forbidden, with the exception of individual approval by the operator.
                        <br/>
                        Individuals can make use of the Swope services by registering via a name and email form. By registering, the user confirms that he/she has reached the age of 18 years or is between the age of 14 and 18 years and has received approval for the unlimited use from their parent or legal guardian.
                        <br/>
                        The specified profile data must be correct, complete and must continuously be kept up-to-date. Multiple registrations are not permitted.
                        <br/>
                        The users’ login credentials must be kept confidential. The user must take appropriate measures to prevent the unauthorized use of this data in order to access Swope.

                        It is strictly forbidden to publish illegal, obscene, offensive, discriminatory, vulgar, violence-glorifying, pornographic, adult content and/or any other content that infringes personal rights. Moreover, aspersions and insults of people and businesses are not permitted. In addition, the harassment through mass distribution of content or messages (spam), the systematic harassment of individual users, hacking in any form, i.e. electronic attacks of any kind on the Swope service, the database and the network of the operator or on individual users, as well as the spread of viruses etc. are strictly prohibited and are reported to the respective authority. Violations lead to the deletion of the item or blocking of the user account. In addition, the operator reserves the right to move, remove posts, disable or to delete user accounts.
                        <br/>
                        With the publication of classified ads, especially in regards to images (e.g. Product images), the user must ensure that copyrights are respected accordingly. This is done by ensuring that the user has all rights to publish and does not violate any rights whatsoever. Uploaded or embedded images/graphics cannot have watermarks or marks of other websites. The operator reserves the right to limit the maximum size of images and to modify or remove images.
                        <br/>
                        The user assures that he does not copy, paste, upload or integrate copyrighted content in any other form to the Swope services. Exceptions are such contents that have been released for further use by the copyright holder.
                        <br/>
                        The user may not use Swope for the promotion of third-party products, the distribution, offering or sale of products, whose distribution, offering or sale is unlawful according to the local law or which are subject to exchanging restrictions (eg. as a result of regulations) as well as for the distribution, offering or sale of food or living creatures.

                        Although the sale of living creatures is generally prohibited, there are separate regulations for offering and exchanging pets in the UK, Italy, Sweden and Germany. In these countries the offering and exchanging of pets are permitted but must comply with the following rules:
                        <br/>
                        The description or the picture of the pet should be chosen wisely and with respect.
                        <br/>
                        The buyer needs to be informed about the age, diseases or any kind of abnormal characteristics of the pet.
                        <br/>
                        Furthermore, the following points are prohibited when exchanging a pet:
                        <br/>
                        Offering, requesting or confirming postal deliveries or the street sales of pets.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging protected species and compounds without the necessary documents. For more information, have a look at https://www.cites.org/.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging exotic, dangerous and poisonous animals.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging pets with any controversial surgeries which are not mandatory for the pet’s health (e.g. ear-cropping, tail docking, devocalization, claws or teeth removal). Requesting such surgeries is strictly prohibited.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging imported pets.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging pets for slaughter or experiments or as live food.
                        <br/>
                        Professional breeding without any approval from an administrative authority.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging of multiple different species or exchanging pets in huge quantities, as this conflicts with the proper treatment of animals.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging pets before they reach an appropriate age. The minimum age for puppies is 8 weeks and for kittens 12 weeks or older.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging pets to users younger than 18 years.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging wolf hybrids.
                        <br/>
                        Exchanging dogs without indication of the registration number. In cases where registration has not yet been made, the puppy’s mother’s registration number must be indicated.
                        <br/>
                        Users exchanging pets are obliged to obtain information about the legal regulations and are forced to comply with these. Further information regarding the sale of living pets and animal welfare can be found in each country’s specific FAQ section.

                    We take data privacy seriously and to the extent that is reasonably feasible for a small group of students conducting a semester long project, we have undertaken a number of necessary steps that we felt were necessary for a better handling of the data in use across the application however no guarantee can be made on the integrity or reliability of the service provided.
                    <br/>
                    When Swope services are used, the operator is provided with a set of personal data. Personal data means information which can directly or indirectly be linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data include name, address, telephone number and e-mail address; however, information about IP addresses and user behaviour when using the services may also constitute personal data. Below, the operator explains to the users of Swope (hereinafter referred to as “user” or “users”) how data, what kind of data and for what purpose data is collected.
                    <br/>
                    This Privacy Policy is a supplement to the terms and conditions and applies to the use of the Swope services and the utilisation of all other offered services on Swope. The privacy policy applied refers to the policy available online at Swope at the time of a user’s specific visit or at the time of the specific use of a Swope service. By using Swope services, the user fully accepts this Privacy Policy. Otherwise the use of any Swope Service is not permitted.
                </p>
                <p class="text-success" id="QU2">

                <p class="text-muted">
                    We collect data in connection with the registration of an account and also in connection with subsequent use of the Swope services. In order to give a good overview of how the processing of personal data is carried out, the personal data has been divided into three categories based on how it is collected:
                    <br/> <strong>1. Data that is given to us by the user</strong>
                    <br/>
                    When an account is created or activities are carried out through the framework of the account, personal information about the individual user is needed. Personal data in this category is characterised by the fact that the user actively provides the data to us by, e.g. completing a web form, reporting incidents to support, or providing us with feedback through functions created for such purposes.
                    <br/>
                    To facilitate the registration for users and to reduce the threat of scammers and spammers the user has one way of registering an account:
                    <br/>
                    Registration with e-mail and e-mail confirmation:
                    <br/>
                    The operator hereby accesses the data of the user, which he has specified during the registration process, i.e. name and e-mail address. The profile data given by the user must be correct, complete and must continuously be kept up-to-date. In order to preserve a certain amount of anonymity towards other users, only the profile picture of the user and username instead of the full name (John Doe) is shown to other users.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>2. Data collected when you use the Swope services</strong>
                    <br/>
                    By using the Swope services and carrying out activities, the user provides data which is stored by the operator in its database. This process takes place for user recognition and to ensure the delivery of the service that the user has requested. The operator will also store information when the user contacts the operator, for example when the user e-mails the operator’s customer support, so that the operator can assist the user and answer open questions. The operator may also use anonymous and aggregated data about such inquiries to improve its services.
                    <br/>
                    By using the Swope services, the operator gathers information about individual user’s activity, e.g. which services and screens are visited within Swope and how they are used. The collected data can be divided into the following types:
                    <br/>
                    <strong style="color:#ff8542 ">a.</strong>
                    Technical information about the user’s device and internet connection
                    <br/>
                    Through server logs and other tools the operator records information about the user’s device and internet connection, including operating system, browser version, IP addresses, cookies and other unique identifiers. The technical information is usually processed as aggregated data in order to analyse how the operator’s services are used. The operator may, however, link such data to the user’s account, for instance so that the operator can customize the Swope services to the user’s device.
                    <br/>
                    <strong style="color:#ff8542 ">b.</strong>
                    Information about the use of the Swope services
                    <br/>
                    The operator registers the user’s account activities such as logging in or out of the user account, and any exchange of products or services through the Swope services. The operator also stores information about a user’s visit on Swope. The operator uses this information, amongst other things, to prevent abuse, to improve the Swope services and to provide users with personalised services, recommendations and advertisements.
                    <br/>
                    <strong style="color:#ff8542 ">c.</strong>
                    Information about users’ location
                    <br/>
                    When Swope is used, the individual user’s location may be estimated through the IP or Geo-location detected on the individual’s device. This information is, for instance, used to show content or provide offers relevant to the user’s location. In order to avoid the identification of a user’s actual exact location, a displaced location of the offeror is shown in the posts.
                    <br/>
                    <strong style="color:#ff8542 ">d.</strong>
                    Cookies and locally stored content
                    <br/>
                    When the user uses the Swope services the operator applies various technologies in order to recognize the user. The Swope website uses “cookies” in order to enable all functionalities of the Swope website and to facilitate the use of the page. For instance, the operator uses cookies so that the user does not have to log in every time he visits the operator’s services. The operator may also store anonymous identifiers locally on the user’s device, especially mobile devices that are incapable of using cookies. See Clause VI below for more information on cookies and anonymous identifiers.

                    The operator uses data of the user for the following purposes:
                    <br/>
                    Summary of purposes: The operator processes, but doesn’t share personal data with any other companies.
                    <br/>
                    More detailed information about purposes is available here below.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>1. Improvement and further development of the Swope Services</strong>
                    <br />
                    The operator uses information to improve its services, for instance by trying to make the registration and log in as user-friendly as possible. This may result in, for instance, registering all steps (screen views, clicks) related to the search of a particular product in order to understand if certain elements of the process are confusing to the users or not. The analysis is usually carried out at an aggregated and anonymized level, but the operator may also use identifiable data to provide technical support and to understand how each individual uses the Swope services.
                    <br/>
                    To improve the Swope services and to detect and analyse errors, the operator uses certain tracking-tools. Therefore, the operator traces user behaviour independently as well as via third-party suppliers. Part of this data also contains (not solely) the users’ IP-Address and user behaviour. Please take note that Google and other third-party suppliers also save this data for statistical reasons and transfer this data to servers in other countries. Some third-party suppliers also reserve the right to share the collected information with other parties.
                    <br/>
                    The operator may inform the user about changes to or improvements of the Swope services by using his e-mail address or through push notifications.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>2. Preventing, limiting and investigating abuse of the Swope services</strong>
                    <br/>
                    We use information to restrict various forms of abuse of the Swope services, such as fraudulent activities, denial of service attacks, spamming, unauthorized logins and other actions that violate our Terms & Conditions, or are prohibited by law.

                <p class="text-muted">
                    The operator will not share, sell, convey or otherwise disclose personal data other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, unless it is required to do so by law or the user has given his/her explicit consent to do so. However, personal data may be transferred due to the following reasons:
                    <br/>
                    <strong>1. Disclosure of personal data to a third party</strong>
                    <br/>
                    If there is suspicion of illegal activities in connection with the use of our services, information may be disclosed to the police and other public authorities subject to a court or administrative order. The operator may share information with other third parties if they can prove an overriding interest in the identity verification of a user as well as in the determination of certain unlawful facts. Further third parties have to substantiate that the knowledge of this information is essential evidence for a prosecution act. The matter stated above does not rule out that personal data assistants may be used. These process personal data on behalf of the operator in accordance with written personal data assistance agreements and instructions. Personal data assistants who obtain access to user data are not granted any right to use individual users’ personal data for purposes other than those stated in this privacy policy.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>2. Transfer of personal data to a country outside the China.</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The operator may transfer parts of user’s personal data to a third country, i.e. a country outside the China. For example, personal data may be stored on servers located in a third country. We have not established any legal mechanisms and do not offer any guarantees on how the data is stored, protected, transfers or otherwise handled.

                    <strong>What is SWOPE?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    SWOPE is an exchange system for students at university. Swope aims to bring students together, have fun and create new friendships.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>What can I use SWOPE for?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Swope is here to enable students to swap objects, but also exchange skills and share experiences.
                    The idea is to exchange things. Those things can be physical items such as a camera, clothes or books. But it can also be non-physical such as skills or experiences. Skills can be artistic, cooking skills, computer skills, etc. Experiences can be about sharing the places you like to go to for food, the nice places you think a person should visit if on holiday in your city.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Where did the idea come from?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The idea came from the statement that on one hand students tend to accumulate a lot of things during their time at university and on the other hand other students might need second hand things because they cannot afford to buy them new.
                    <br/>
                    However, instead of having more material things by exchanging a physical thing for another one, some students might actually want to swop objects for a dinner for example, exchange that this application would allow.
                    <br/>
                    With the cultural aspect of this project and the travel it implies, we also thought it might be a good idea to have students sharing their experiences about their cities or countries with foreign students, making their stay more enjoyable. For example, sharing deals about a place to go for food, a great park to go for a run, etc.

                    <strong>How do I exchange an item?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    To exchange an Item you must first create a profile, after you have created your profile you can add your items/skills/experiences to your profile. On the home page of SWOPE is where you can find other users items or you can use the search function at the top. Click on the item you would like then hit the ‘exchange’ button, this will allow you to make an offer. If the user accepts your offer you can exchange items are your own discretion.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>What can I exchange?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    You can exchange anything you think another student will find useful. This can range from physical items to skills or experiences, look at ‘What can I use SWOPE for?’ for more information.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>How do I make an offer?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Click on the item you would like then hit the ‘exchange’ button, this will allow you to make an offer.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Can I exchange with money?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    No. You cannot exchange items, skills or experiences for money. You can however exchange items that you have purchased previously. All exchanges are at the user’s discretion.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Can I give something away for free?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Yes. You can give your items, skills and experiences away for free. This helps you get rid of your items if you need them to go or you could just help others by sharing your skills and experiences with those who need help.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>How do I know if an exchange is fair?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    All exchanges are at the discretion of the user. If you think an exchange is fair then you can willingly exchange your goods, if you don’t think an exchange is fair then you do not have to exchange your goods.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>How do I exchange an item safely and securely?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    The safest possible option would be via post. There is no security that you will receive your item so use this service at your own risk.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>What if I don't like my exchanged item?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    If you don’t like an offer another user has made then you can reject the offer. However if you have accepted the offer and exchanged your item willingly for another then there isn’t a way to get your item back unless you want to make another exchange. You must decide before you exchange an item whether or not you want it.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>What if I don't want to exchange an item anymore?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    You can’t un-exchange your item but you can however exchange your unwanted item for another.
